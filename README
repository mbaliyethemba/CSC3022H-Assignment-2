Name: A Volumetric Image Manipulation Tool using raw pointers


Description: 
This assignment is written to in responce to answer assignment 2 question to create a volumetric image manipulation tool using raw pointers.  
It stores binary data into a dynamically allocated 3D array and can perform operations described below. 

Instructions: Extract the tar file. Navigate to the destination folder from the command line. Enter make
Use the following  commands to run the different options.

  ./ volimage <baseName> //print number of images and number of bytes used
  ./ volimage <baseName> -g i output_file_name //extract the ith row of all slices to output_file_name with corresponding header.
  ./ volimage <baseName> -x i output file name //extract the ith slice to output_file_name with corresponding header.
  ./ volimage <baseName> -d i j output_file_name //create a raw output file with the difference between slice i and j.
 
 
	 

List of files: 

VolImage.h -header file for VolImage class.
VolImage.cpp -defines VolImage class methods .
VolImageDriver.cpp -driver file for the program
Makefile - used to run the program.
